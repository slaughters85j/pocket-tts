## Project Overview

pocket-tts is a CPU-based text-to-speech (TTS) model. The project uses a flow-based language model architecture with a neural audio codec (Mimi) for efficient speech synthesis.

**Key Architecture Components:**
- **FlowLMModel**: Transformer-based flow language model that generates latent representations from text using Lagrangian Self Distillation (LSD)
- **MimiModel**: Neural audio codec (from the `moshi` package) that compresses/decompresses audio to/from latent representations
- **Conditioners**: Text processing via SentencePiece tokenizer and lookup table embeddings
- **Streaming Architecture**: The entire pipeline supports streaming generation via stateful modules
- **Web API**: FastAPI-based server for HTTP API access with web interface

## Common Commands

### Setup and Development
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
uvx pre-commit install

# Run tests (3 parallel workers)
uv run pytest -n 3 -v

# Run a single test
uv run pytest tests/test_python_api.py -v

# Run CLI locally (editable install)
uv run pocket-tts generate
uv run pocket-tts serve
```

### Linting and Formatting
Pre-commit handles this automatically, but you can run manually:
```bash
# Ruff will run automatically on commit via pre-commit
# Includes: ruff-check, ruff-format (with --fix), and import sorting
```

### Building (No Build Step)
This is a pure Python package with Rust extensions in `training/rust_exts/audio_ds/` for training-time audio processing. The main package does not require building.

### macOS Service (Swift/Xcode Projects)
The `macos-service/` directory contains Swift projects that require Xcode builds. **For all builds and Swift tests, follow the `xcode-and-swift-tests` skill** (`.cursor/skills/xcode-and-swift-tests/`).
```bash
# Always use the xcode-builder-agent or xcodebuild-clean wrapper
# DO NOT use bare `swift build` or `xcodebuild` (miniforge PATH conflicts)

# Development/Testing - Use the consolidated script
cd macos-service/scripts
./dev-test.sh    # Kills old processes, builds, installs, opens Xcode

# Or manually using the clean build wrapper
/Users/system-backup/bin/xcodebuild-clean -scheme PocketTTSMenuBar build

# Or use the xcode-builder-agent Task tool with subagent_type="xcode-builder-agent"
```

### Testing (`tests/`)
- `test_python_api.py`: Tests for public Python API

### macOS Service Integration (`macos-service/`)

Native macOS integration for system-wide text-to-speech Quick Action.

```

**Key Features:**
- **Quick Action**: Select text anywhere on macOS → Right-click → Services → "Read Selection with Pocket TTS"
- **Menu Bar App**: Native Swift app for voice selection and server monitoring
- **LaunchAgent**: Auto-start TTS server on login
- **Shared Configuration**: `~/Library/Application Support/Pocket TTS/` (compatible with Electron app)
- **Progressive Streaming**: Audio starts playing within 1-2 seconds
- **Voice Support**: Both predefined voices and custom voice cloning

**Important Notes:**
- Swift projects must be built with `xcode-builder-agent` or `xcodebuild-clean` wrapper (miniforge PATH contamination)
- Use `dev-test.sh` for development: kills old processes, builds both packages, installs Quick Action, opens Xcode
- Configuration and voices are shared between Electron app, menu bar app, and Quick Action at `~/Library/Application Support/Pocket TTS/`
- Quick Action reads are ephemeral (no history integration)
- Server must be running on localhost:8765 for Quick Action to work
- **Critical fix**: StreamingWAVPlayer now waits for actual playback duration instead of hardcoded 0.5s (prevents audio cutoff)
- **Critical fix**: Menu bar app uses traditional AppKit lifecycle instead of SwiftUI App (fixes menu not appearing)

## Development Workflow

### Key Patterns

1. **Streaming Generation**: The model generates audio frame-by-frame (12.5 Hz frame rate, 80ms per frame). All modules inherit from `StatefulModule` to maintain internal state.

2. **Voice Cloning**: Audio prompts are encoded via Mimi encoder to create "voice state" (latent representations + speaker embeddings). This state is cached via `lru_cache` on `_cached_get_state_for_audio_prompt()`.

3. **Flow Matching**: Uses Lagrangian Self Distillation (LSD) with configurable decode steps. Fewer steps = faster but lower quality.

4. **EOS Detection**: Model predicts end-of-speech via an EOS head. Generation continues for `frames_after_eos` frames after EOS is detected.

5. **Config-Driven**: Model architecture is defined in YAML configs. Weights are loaded from HuggingFace Hub via `safetensors`.

### Important Implementation Details

- **Thread Safety**: The code is NOT thread-safe. Server mode does not support concurrent requests.
- **Batching**: Batch size is always 1. No batching support currently.
- **Device**: Defaults to CPU. GPU does not provide speedup for this small model.
- **Torch Threads**: `torch.set_num_threads(1)` in `tts_model.py` for optimal CPU performance
- **dtype**: Models use float32 by default (configurable in YAML)
- **Beartype**: Runtime type checking is enabled via beartype claw in `__init__.py`

### Adding Features

When adding features, be aware of:
- The streaming architecture: any changes to model forward passes need to maintain state correctly
- The config system: new model parameters must be added to config classes in `utils/config.py`
- The public API: only `TTSModel` is exported; keep implementation details internal
- Ruff formatting: line length 100, LF line endings, skip magic trailing comma

### Model Weights

Weights are downloaded from HuggingFace Hub on first use:
- Model weights: `hf://kyutai/pocket-tts/tts_b6369a24.safetensors`
- Tokenizer: `hf://kyutai/pocket-tts/tokenizer.model`
- Voice prompts: `hf://kyutai/tts-voices/<speaker>/<style>.wav`

The `download_if_necessary()` utility handles `hf://` URLs and caches locally.

## Common Gotchas

1. **PyTorch Version**: Requires PyTorch 2.5+. Version 2.4.0 produces incorrect audio.
2. **Python Version**: Supports Python 3.10 through 3.14 (>= 3.10,<3.15).
3. **uv Python Preference**: Set to "only-managed" in pyproject.toml because system Python may lack headers.
4. **CPU-Only PyTorch**: Uses PyTorch CPU index from `download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` in uv config.
5. **Web Dependencies**: FastAPI and Uvicorn are included for server functionality.
